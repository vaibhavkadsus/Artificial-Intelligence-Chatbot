# Artificial-Intelligence-Chatbot
Explanation of the Code:
Knowledge Base: A Map<String, String> is used to store predefined responses for specific inputs.
User Input Handling: The chatbot reads input from the user, normalizes it (converts it to lowercase), and checks if there is a matching response in the knowledge base.
Simple Loop: The chatbot runs in a loop, continuously interacting with the user until they type "exit".
Extensibility: You can add more entries to the knowledgeBase map to expand the chatbot's responses.
